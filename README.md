# Searching4

A project made with the purpose to practice and study more about ReacJS. The first version was created by 4Front group for study during [NewTab](https://newtab.academy/) training.

### `About the project`

Our app consists in a web application where you can search for a tweet typing a word. For example, if you type "reactjs" you will get a list(array) of posts with this term in specific as result.
The home page will start the application searching a word pre configured at 'getInitialSearch'.

### `About API`

All data showed in our web app come from [Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs)

## `Download and run`

First, download the project

```
git clone https://github.com/pedrohrb7/Searching4.git

### `Attention Points`

**You should create your own access key and use for your purpose**

Why ? Because if I change my key this one (and this project) will stop work
